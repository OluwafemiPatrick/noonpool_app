Ultimate Pool for Crypto Miners


## About App

Noonpool is a crypto mining pool application that provides efficient, safe, and stable cryptocurrency mining services for miners across the world. 
The software allows users to combine their mining resources into a single pool and mine up to four cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.

The pool was built on the Foundation V2 Stratum software and the blockchain nodes for each of the supported currency is hosted on multiple AWS servers.

A mobile app was also developed using Flutter which provides many functionalities such as:
- a stratum connection URL unique to miners for connecting their mining devices to the pool.
- monitor the performance of their mining devices.
- in-built crypto wallet to safely store and transfer user assets.
- mining calculator to estimate the average earning from devices based on factors such as mining hashrate, network difficulty, electricity usage, etc.

This project is the mobile interface that allows users to connect to the pool and monitor their assets
